みなさん、こんにちは
Minasan, kon'nichiwa

Hi, I’m Ajay Banstola — a software engineer and AI enthusiast with over 4 years of industry experience and a deep curiosity for building intelligent systems. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where I also contribute to research on AI-driven program analysis and fuzzing techniques. My work spans from building scalable backend systems and cloud-native applications to deploying machine learning models in real-world environments. I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering and AI, whether that means integrating large language models into production workflows or designing systems that make data-driven decisions. I’ll be joining Blue Partner as an AI Integration Engineer Intern this summer, and I’m excited about creating meaningful tech that blends smart automation with human impact.

Outside of tech, I love staying active and competitive whether it’s playing badminton, table tennis, or a strategic game of chess. I also unwind by diving into the world of manga, which has been a big part of my life and even sparked my interest in learning Japanese. It’s been a fun challenge picking up the language, and it adds a whole new layer of appreciation to the stories I enjoy. These hobbies keep me balanced and curious, both in and out of work.
