## Problem Statement with Thought Process:

We need to find the kth node from the back of the linked list. Imagine your four finger, where index finger is P1 and pinky finger is P2. To find 4th node from back, we place our hand at the end of the linked list, the index finger points to the 4th node from back. We took pinky finger kth steps from P1 and then moved P2 to the end of the list. Answer is pointed by P1.
